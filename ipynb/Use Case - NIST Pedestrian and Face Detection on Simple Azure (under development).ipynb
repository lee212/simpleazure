OpenCV is a Computer Vision library including the SVM classifier and the HOG object detector for pedestrian detection and INRIA Person Dataset [2] is one of popular samples for both training and testing purposes. In this document, we deploy Apache Spark on Mesos clusters to train and apply detection models from OpenCV using Python API."

    "When it comes to deploy applications and build clusters for batch-processing large datasets, Ansible scripts play a big role such as installation and configuration towards available machines. Ansible provides abstractions by Playbook Roles and reusability by Include statements. We define X application in X Ansible Role, for example, and use include statements to combine with other applications e.g. Y or Z. Five Ansible roles are used in this use case to build clusters for Human and Face Detection with INRIA dataset. The main Ansible playbook runs Ansible roles in order which looks like:\n",

The number of machines and groups for clusters e.g. namenodes and datanodes are specified in the file and Ansible inventory file, a list of target machines with groups, is generated once machines are ready to use. Ansible roles run to install applications on virtual clusters.\n",

Apache Zookeeper is included in the mesos role so that mesos slaves find an elected mesos leader from the zookeeper. Spark, as a data processing layer, provides two options for distributed job processing, batch job processing via a cluster mode and real-time processing via a client mode. The Mesos dispatcher runs on a masters group to accept a batch job submission and Spark interactive shell, which is the client mode, provides real-time processing on any node in the cluster. Either way, Spark is installed after a scheduler layer i.e. mesos to identify a master host for a job submission. Installation of OpenCV, INRIA Person Dataset and Human and Face Detection Python applications are followed."
