Tutorial
==========
The tutorial in this page assists you in learning how to use Simple Azure on Python. 
In this tutorial, we creates Windows Azure Virtual Machines for Azure Data Science Core and BioLinux with IPython.
It shows usage in pre-configured environments but it explains main features that you need to know. 
For more detail of function APIs, module descriptions might be helpful. 
There are several tools and libraries that we have used such as StarCluster, IPython, azure-sdk-for-python, Bioblend, etc.

You can also have an interactive python tutorial via IPython Notebook to learn Simple Azure.
